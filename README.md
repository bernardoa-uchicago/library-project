# library-project

Hello!!!

Welcome to my personal library project. This is a file handler that functions much like a real-life library. You can open books, add new downloaded books and delete them all in one place.

Note that this is not supposed to be used for a gigantic library as it was programmed for personal use and the more books added the slower the program gets.

Make sure you have all the libraries below:
 - Python3
 - Send2Trash
 - os
 - shutil
 - subprocess
 - PyQt6

The project includes a graphical user interface, for a more user friendly approach, and a text user interface that uses terminal inputs for computations.

Thank you for using this project :)

To run the Text User Interface, navigate to this directory on your computer, make sure all libraries have been downloaded, then run "python3 tui.py"

 - To facilitate your use, you can drag files from any finder window into the terminal to avoid path typos.

To run the Graphical User Interface, navigate to this directory on your computer, make sure all libraries have been downloaded, then run "python3 gui.py"
